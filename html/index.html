Now, passing the 15-year mark as an independent firm, we would like to thank the many people and institutions who have been such an integral part of our history and who, we know, will contribute significantly to our future.</div></td>

As investors, not operators, we underwrite the strength of the leadership as much as the financial statements, and we appreciate the experience, dedication and vision of our management partners. We have been privileged to support some of the best teams in their industries and, with a shared purpose, we have overcome strategic and tactical challenges, navigated cyclical downturns and worked diligently to strengthen and grow each company. We share our track record with these teams, who are our partners in the fullest sense.</div></td>

These investors include endowments, foundations, public and corporate pension funds, family offices, banks, insurance companies and others.  Through a variety of fundraising environments, we have been especially grateful to have the loyal support and trust of some of the most sophisticated and committed long-term investors in the industry. By maintaining our conservative middle-market strategy and focus, we hope to continue generating consistent and attractive returns for our investors for many funds to come.</div></td>

We particularly want to acknowledge our relationship lenders who have invested their capital alongside us in support of our portfolio companies, our investment banking advisors who have guided many of our transactions, our network of advisors who have counseled us on issues ranging from in-depth primary due diligence to complex transaction structuring, and our many independent board members whose wisdom has enriched the opportunities available to our companies. All have been an integral part of our investment process. </div></td>
