That worked great until dynamic sites came around and I could no longer test my code locally resulting in a, well, less than perfect workflow. You see, once I start getting into dynamic sites (I started with Cold Fusion and ASP classic) I developed a habit of developing directly on a remote server, usually the production site, with tools like <a title=\"Adobe Dreamweaver\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html\">Dreamweaver</a> that allowed me to connect and work directly on the remote machine. It was in fact this workflow that kept me a loyal Dreamweaver user for the better part of a decade as nothing else at the time could compete with this type of workflow very well.<span id=\"more-5170\"></span></p>\n<p>The next step in my development evolution was a local server. When I was still on Windows I would use <a title=\"XAMPPS\" href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\">XAMPP</a> or even IIS and later when I moved to Mac I discovered <a title=\"MAMP Pro\" href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/\">MAMP Pro</a> and finally <a title=\"Softaculous AMPPS\" href=\"http://www.ampps.com/\">AMPPS</a>. For the first time I had a true Apache, MySQL, PHP stack on my local computer that, at least for major versions, could mimic the bulk of my server environments with only minimal modifications. It worked well but it wasn’t perfect. Switching computers could be a nightmare and should anything in the stack become corrupt I was in for some serious trouble. But at least I wasn&#8217;t working on the remote server anymore. This workflow was good, but just not good enough.</p>\n<p>So for the last 5 years I’ve played around with various combinations of MAMP Pro, AMPPS, <a title=\"Homebrew\" href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, XAMPP and a few other solutions in search of the perfect server that would mimic my production development almost perfectly, be easily portable and would require a bare minimum amount of maintenance.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time, and in parallel to my quest for the perfect development environment, I have been a heavy user of another now popular technology, <a title=\"Virtual Machines on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\">virtual machines</a>, which I use to test sites on Windows, Ubuntu and other platforms where I could replicate neither the browser nor the operating system very well using my Mac. While this technology was rather cumbersome 5 years ago when I started using it, today it has matured to the point where you can use a virtual machine as easily as you can use a word processor and with about the same performance level you would expect from the host OS.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been developing locally and using virtual machines for quite some team I had never been able to successfully combine the two goals. Sure I had heard of Puppet, Chef and Vagrant but they seemed to me to be anything but mature and far more of a hassle than getting a proper MAMP or AMPPS environment.</p>\n<p>Finally, last weekend <a title=\"Mark Jaquith on WordPress\" href=\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/\">Mark Jaquith</a> changed my opinion on all of this with his <a title=\"WordCamp San Francisco\" href=\"http://sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp San Francisco</a> talk titled <a title=\"Watch Mark\'s WordCamp talk\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/28/mark-jaquith-confident-commits-delightful-deploys-2/\">Confident Commits, Delightful Deploys</a>. He pointed out just how mature Vagrant and Puppet had become and how easily they could be utilized to build a local development environment utilizing the same OS and packages I use in production (<a title=\"Ubuntu\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a>, Apache, NGINX, etc) and requiring only minutes to setup or tear down once the initial configuration was complete.</p>\n<p>The Holy Grail of development environments has been found and it doesn’t require a whole heck of a lot get started.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install <a title=\"Virtualbox\" href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org\">Virtualbox and its Guest Additions</a>. This is the virtualization engine that will allow your new development environment to run.</li>\n<li>Install <a title=\"Vagrant\" href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a>. It doesn’t matter what your OS is, this is a free and easy download package that serves as a wrapper around the Virtual machine in Virtualbox. Once configured it will download the image you need, set up the virtual machine and pass it off to a provisioning script to make sure everything you need is installed and configured.</li>\n<li>Get a base configuration. This is easy with sites like <a title=\"https://puphpet.com/\" href=\"https://puphpet.com/\">https://puphpet.com/</a> which allow you to configure what you need for a basic development environment. I started with it and then customized it to meet my needs. Mostly I just changed a few variables to make sure it worked for me a little easier out of the box. You can find <a title=\"My current Vagrant/Puppet script\" href=\"https://github.com/Bit51/Bit51-Vagrant\">my modified configuration on GitHub</a> if you’re interested.</li>\n<li>Start working. Once you have a script getting a development environment is as easy as going to the location of the script you downloaded and typing <em>vagrant up</em> in the terminal.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why Use Virtual Machines?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, it’s a bit of work to set this all up but once you do there are some serious benefits to this workflow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you’re in a team <strong>everyone will be developing on the same environment</strong>. We’re not there at my day job yet but we’re getting there. Once implemented it won’t matter if folks are on Windows, Mac or Linux. The development environment will be the same throughout allowing us to spend far less time as a team debugging.</li>\n<li><strong>Your development environment can match your production environment</strong>. If you’re deploying to a given environment why not work in that same environment? Again this saves time and sanity in debugging as you’re no longer changing configurations as you push your project up the line.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed and efficiency</strong>. Once you have Vagrant, an install script, and Virtualbox you can switch machines, run up or down new environments and generally get to coding a lot faster without having to spend hours tweaking your local setup to match your servers as closely as possible. For me this is the real benefit at the moment. I can work on any machine I happen to have handy and I no longer have to worry about either setup or whether I’ve configured the new machine to match the old. It just works.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Room to Improve</h3>\n<p>Of course, as I’ve only been using this for a couple of days there is still room for improvement in my setup. In particular I need to work on both my Puppet script and Vagrant box to take into account running PHP over fastcgi as well as a couple of other changes. It’s darn close and I’m sure with a little more time I’ll have it pretty much perfect. Fortunately bringing new environments up and down is so easy that I really have nothing to lose with tweaking it out.</p>\n<h3>Give it a try</h3>\n<p>One of the best things about trying a new method like this is you don’t have to give up the way you currently work. I admit I did delete AMPSS from my computer about a day after starting with Vagrant and <a title=\"Puppet Labs\" href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> as I simply don’t need it anymore but there is no reason you have to. There is nothing to conflict with so your old setup so the only thing you have to lose is a few minutes of your time and an obsolete way of dealing with local development.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://bit51.com/virtual-machines-the-holy-grail-of-local-web-development/\">Virtual Machines&#8230; The Holy Grail of Local Web Development</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://bit51.com\">Bit51</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://bit51.com/virtual-machines-the-holy-grail-of-local-web-development/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WordCamp San Francisco… That’s a Wrap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://bit51.com/wordcamp-san-francisco-thats-a-wrap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://bit51.com/wordcamp-san-francisco-thats-a-wrap/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 02:06:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Professionalism\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://bit51.com/?p=5161\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:551:\"<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity to travel to San Francisco for my third WordCamp of 2013, WordCamp San Francisco.

For those of you who are unfamiliar <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamps</a> are regional WordPress conferences held in cities throughout the world. As part of the <a title=\"WordPress Foundation\" href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Foundation</a> they&#8217;re cheap (usually only $20), are packed with great speakers and can be one of the best places to network and discuss all things WordPress.</p>\n<p>Of all the WordCamps held throughout the year WordCamp San Francisco is the king. This is the largest and seemingly most well-funded WordCamp there is. As it is located at the home of <a title=\"Automattic\" href=\"http://automattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a> (the company behind WordPress.com) it attracts folks from all over the world as attendees, sponsors and speakers providing a depth of knowledge and experience that simply isn&#8217;t available anywhere else.<span id=\"more-5161\"></span></p>\n<p>For any of you who attend conferences regularly you know these events can be hit or miss. Sessions can be shallow, speakers can be horrible and the crowd can be about as exciting as that in the local morgue. Fortunately WordCamp San Francisco is not like that.</p>\n<p>For two days (four if you count travel days) I learned from the best and brightest in the WordPress world. Speakers included <a title=\"Mark Jaquith\" href=\"http://markjaquith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Jaquith</a> who&#8217;s talk, <a title=\"Confident Commits, Delightful Deploys on WordPress.tv\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/28/mark-jaquith-confident-commits-delightful-deploys-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Confident Commits, Delightful Deploys</a>, has already left me reworking my own development environment by dropping <a title=\"AMPPS\" href=\"http://www.ampps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AMPPS</a> in favor of a virtual machine. Later <a title=\"Mike Adams on WordPress.org\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/mdawaffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Adams</a> taught me a thing or two about front-end security (something I rarely find in a conference anymore) and <a title=\"Carrie Dils\" href=\"http://www.carriedils.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Dils</a> reminded me that collaboration is often preferable to competition in a community like WordPress.</p>\n<p>Unlike other conferences where the learning stops with the sessions, at WordCamp San Francisco the sessions were just the beginning. When the sessions were over I spent the weekend hanging out with <a title=\"BobWP\" href=\"http://bobwp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Dunn</a> who, along with splitting a cab, introduced me to some incredible folks from all over the WordPress community. I tend to lose track of what is going on outside of code and Bob, a trainer himself, introduced me to a number of folks in the training and content arena that are doing some incredibly awesome things.</p>\n<p>Of course WordPress wasn&#8217;t the only exciting item on my agenda for the weekend. I wound up meeting a long lost cousin of my father&#8217;s who filled me in on a whole side of the family neither myself nor even my father really knows anything about. Among other things it turns out my great-grandparents were members of a <a title=\"Burning Bush Colony\" href=\"http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ueb07\" target=\"_blank\">religious cult right here in Texas</a> about 100 years ago and my great-grandmother is even burried only a couple of hours from me in Tyler, TX. Considering I never knew I had any relatives outside of Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin that was quite a surprise in itself.</p>\n<p>Finally, as with all good communities I got the chance to sit back and relax with a number of new friends and old who make their living around WordPress. While learning the next greatest technique might be pretty awesome (and WordCamp San Francisco was chocked full of such awesomeness) it is the community and friends you make that will be there when you get stuck. These are the folks we can turn to for help or just a good laugh when the time is right and there is no replacement for that most important of WordPress attributes, the people.</p>\n<p><em>*<strong>Updated: </strong>Thank you <a title=\"Konstantin Kovshenin\" href=\"http://kovshenin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Konstantin</a> for pointing out that Automattic is behind <a title=\"WordPress.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com</a>, not WordPress.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://bit51.com/wordcamp-san-francisco-thats-a-wrap/\">WordCamp San Francisco&#8230; That&#8217;s a Wrap</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://bit51.com\">Bit51</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://bit51.com/wordcamp-san-francisco-thats-a-wrap/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Better WP Security 3.5.5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"http://bit51.com/better-wp-security-3-5-5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://bit51.com/better-wp-security-3-5-5/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 20:46:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://bit51.com/?p=5157\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:366:\"<p>A quick update today to push some minor fixes and an updated Turkish translation.

Sure, you can create a <a title=\"CSS Image Sprites\" href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp\" target=\"_blank\">sprite</a> to make it a little easier but creating, maintaining and, in some cases even using that sprite can be an exercise in futility if you aren’t intimately familiar with CSS. To complicate matters, if you don’t use a sprite you have to download a separate resource for each and every image you use and possibly another separate set of images if you need to resize the images due to screen size or pixel density.</p>\n<p>Fotunately there is a better way.<span id=\"more-4894\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FontAwesome</strong></a>, a free package by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davegandy\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Gandy</a>, puts together <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/\" target=\"_blank\">361 different icons</a> including every major social media network, into a single font that can be scaled and used very easily with a little CSS (it is what I use for the icons on the top right corner of this site).</p>\n<p>While there is a plugin that you can use to add FontAwesome to WordPress I’m going to show you a better way to do it. We’re going to add it directly to your theme to avoid any unnecessary overhead and make it easy to update when the next version comes out.</p>\n<p>1.) <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/assets/font-awesome.zip\">Download FontAwesome</a> and extract its contents.</p>\n<p>2.) Copy the Font and CSS folders to your theme folder. If you already have a these folders in your theme just copy their contents from the FontAwesome package to your own folders.</p>\n<p>3.) Add FontAwesome to Functions.php.</p>\n<p>To do this we’re going to create a new function called <em>load_fontawesome</em> by entering the following lines into functions.php:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/5996225.js\"></script><noscript><pre><code class=\"language- \">function load_fontawesome() {\n\n}</code></pre></noscript>\n<p>4.) Within the function we just created we need to register our FontAwesome CSS and add it to the scripts queue so WordPress can use it. To do this take the function you created in step 3 and add the <em>wp_register_style</em> and <em>wp_enqueue_style</em> functions as you see below:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/5996236.js\"></script><noscript><pre><code class=\"language- \">function load_fontawesome() {\n\n  wp_register_style( \'fonts-awesome\', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . \'/css/font-awesome.min.css\' );\n  wp_enqueue_style( \'fonts-awesome\' );\n\n}</code></pre></noscript>\n<p>The <em>wp_register_style</em> code tells WordPress there is a stylesheet called <em>fonts-awesome</em> and it uses the font-awesome.min.css file in the css folder within your theme. Then the <em>wp_enqueue_style</em> tells WordPress to actually use the style by putting it in the header of your WordPress pages.</p>\n<p>5.) Hook the <em>load_fontawesome</em> function into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Finally we need to tell WordPress when to run our function. We’re going to do this using the WordPress <em>add_action</em> function to tell it to load our function when WordPress processes all of our scripts and stylesheets. To do this we just add one more line to our code:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/5996250.js\"></script><noscript><pre><code class=\"language- \">add_action( \'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'load_fontawesome\' );\nfunction load_fontawesome() {\n \n  wp_register_style( \'fonts-awesome\', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . \'/css/font-awesome.min.css\' );\n  wp_enqueue_style( \'fonts-awesome\' );\n \n}</code></pre></noscript>\n<p>6.) Start using icons.</p>\n<p>FontAwesome is ready to use. To actually add an icon to our site <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/\" target=\"_blank\">find the icon you want on the FontAwesome site</a> and remember the icon’s name next to its image. Then add it to your code with the <em>i</em> tag just like I’ve done for the Facebook icon in the code below:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/5996261.js\"></script><noscript><pre><code class=\"language- \">&lt;i class=&quot;icon-facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></noscript>\n<p>The above code you should get you the following icon (note that you will need to switch to the text view in a page or post to make it work):</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i class=\"icon-facebook\"></i></p>\n<p>That’s it. You can add icons in the body of posts or pages, in widgets or anywhere else you need them. As a bonus, if the icon you want isn’t there today you may <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/community/#requesting-new-icons\" target=\"_blank\">request it from the developer</a>. The project seems to be updated regularly (they’ve added dozens of new icons just since May) so it looks as if there is a better than average chance your request could be accepted.</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re ready to update FontAwesome simply re-download it and copy the new CSS and font files over your existing files. It is that easy.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://bit51.com/add-social-media-icons-to-your-site-without-images/\">Add Social Media Icons To Your Site Without Images</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://bit51.com\">Bit51</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://bit51.com/add-social-media-icons-to-your-site-without-images/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Share Center Pro 2.4.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://bit51.com/share-center-pro-2-4-6/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://bit51.com/share-center-pro-2-4-6/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 14:28:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://bit51.com/?p=5120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:519:\"<p>So Facebook changed the way they implement the like button&#8230; back in November&#8230; Admittedly I completely missed this change until the like button stopped working in Share Center Pro this week.

Frankly, it really wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. As Bit51 has grown I needed to make sure that any change this big wasn&#8217;t just done for a any old reason but instead was done with users in mind.</p>\n<p>While I agonized over all sorts of details throughout the decision process, when I really broke it down there were just 3 simple reasons why I think Disqus is a better platform for both myself and the folks who participate here on Bit51:<span id=\"more-5113\"></span></p>\n<h3>1.) Disqus has the ability to more easily manage comments and discussions from a single location</h3>\n<p>I know WordPress has it&#8217;s notifications and all but they simply aren&#8217;t easy to use. In addition, as I manage comments on a couple of sites keeping track of what is where was starting to take up way too much of my time.</p>\n<p>Disqus puts it all together on my existing sites and gives me the ability to expand to other sites later if I need to. In addition, not only does it allow me to track comments on sites I manage, but it also lets me track comments I leave on other sites that use Disqus. It&#8217;s early yet but I think this could really help me keep in touch with folks over a wider range of platforms.</p>\n<h3>2.) I wanted to streamline the plugin base of this site</h3>\n<p>By turning on Disqus I managed to turn off <a title=\"nRelate\" href=\"http://nrelate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">nRelate</a>, <a title=\"Akismet\" href=\"http://akismet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akismet</a> and numerous <a title=\"Jetpack\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack</a> features that were all being used to enhance comments in one fashion or another. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, these aren&#8217;t bad plugins, but how many plugins is too many? Now comments and related functions are handled solely by the Disqus plugin resulting, hopefully, in a faster and less cluttered site.</p>\n<h3>3.) User experience</h3>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, I believe Disqus does more for the user experience than any of the competition. With instant updating, the ability to log in from numerous services (or not at all) and the ability to easily follow and interact with a site I think it is simply a better way to help encourage participation.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked at other commenting systems. I tried <a title=\"Livefyre\" href=\"http://www.livefyre.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Livefyre</a> and <a title=\"CommentLuv on WordPress.org\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentluv/\" target=\"_blank\">CommentLuv</a> numerous times in the past but the former never did work well for me and <a title=\"3 Reasons Why I Stopped Using CommentLuv\" href=\"http://bit51.com/3-reasons-why-i-stopped-using-commentluv/\" target=\"_blank\">the latter really doesn&#8217;t do much but toot its own horn</a>. Disqus just seems to be the best platform to hopefully build real conversions on without gimmicks or unneeded garbage.</p>\n<p><em>So what do you think? Is Disqus worth it?

Do you know how to keep them safe as well?<span id=\"more-4899\"></span></p>\n<h3>What are people thinking?</h3>\n<p>This afternoon we spent some time at a local shopping center. While browsing around Best Buy I decided to stop and take a look at the Chromebooks on display as, well, they&#8217;re kinda cool.</p>\n<p>So naturally, as it&#8217;s a Chromebook, the first thing I open up is the Chrome browser and what comes up? Someone&#8217;s Facebook account, still logged in. I could have posted, changed his profile or, if he managed a business page, done just about anything I wanted to it.</p>\n<p>Seriously, what was that person thinking? Why would anyone do something so seemingly dumb?</p>\n<h3>Complacency can be the problem</h3>\n<p>The fact is, the user in question probably didn&#8217;t think twice about logging into Facebook at the store. They&#8217;re probably used to having Facebook and every other social network available to them everywhere they go and this was just one more convenient place to access that data. I know myself that it&#8217;s easy to forget these things and we all see such problems all to often. So what can be done about it? How can we be secure when it is so easy to get to our accounts from just about anywhere, even the local store?</p>\n<h3>1.) Don&#8217;t log into any sites on a computer you don&#8217;t own</h3>\n<p>This seems simple but as I mentioned above it&#8217;s all too common. Resist the temptation. Missing your nephews 1st birthday party or some other major event isn&#8217;t a good excuse to log in from the local big-box store. Posts aren&#8217;t going away and they won&#8217;t physically trasport you to some other place. Fight the &#8220;right now&#8221; impulse and wait until you&#8217;re somewhere safe to login. I know it isn&#8217;t easy and I&#8217;m guilty myself (I was infamous for leaving sites logged in at a public computer at work) but restraint is something we should all strive for if we want to have any kind of security.</p>\n<p>Keeping your social media on devices you own doesn&#8217;t just apply to you public computers either. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the device is still in the store or in the living room of a trusted friend. Don&#8217;t do it. If you forget to log off even the most well intentioned practical joke can cost you some serious embarrassment (at a minimum) and could cause a lot worse if you have access to a company account from within your own login.</p>\n<h3>2.) Use two-factor authentication</h3>\n<p>One way many social media accounts are hacked is weak passwords or passwords shared with other compromised sites. While using a strong password and using different passwords for each site has become a lot easier with services like <a title=\"Lastpass\" href=\"https://lastpass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lastpass</a> there is still a better way to secure most of the big social networking sites.</p>\n<p>You see, a password is just something you <em>know</em>. Unfortunately, if you know it so can someone else which leads to a major weakness in the whole idea of password security. Two-factor authentication increases the security of your accounts with both something you <em>know</em> and something you <em>have</em>. In other words, to get into a site protected with two-factor authentication you&#8217;ll need your password and, in most cases, to <em>have</em> your phone physically with you for an app like <a title=\"Google Authenticator on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator\" target=\"_blank\">Google Authenticator</a> which will give you a code that is only good for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Most of the big networks including <a title=\"Facebook login approvals\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a title=\"Twitter Login Verification\" href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2013/getting-started-login-verification\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a title=\"Google Two Factor Authentication\" href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, <a title=\"LinkedIn Two Factor Authentication\" href=\"http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/05/31/protecting-your-linkedin-account-with-two-step-verification/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>, <a title=\"App.net Two-Factor Authentication\" href=\"http://blog.app.net/2013/03/13/added-security-for-your-app-net-account/\" target=\"_blank\">App.net</a> and others all support two-factor authentication in one way or another. Facebook allows you to do it right through the Facebook app on your phone or text message, Twitter and LinkedIn use text messages and App.net and Google both use Google Authenticator. It&#8217;s easy to set up, it&#8217;s easy to use and it really does work.</p>\n<p>Of course, as with any security measure two-factor authentication isn&#8217;t perfect but if you value your accounts and, more importantly, you value your friends and anyone else you contact with your accounts two-factor authentication can take your security far beyond a basic password.</p>\n<h3>3.) Don&#8217;t let accounts go dormant</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that we live in the age of social media with new services for everything from general friends to seeing how many beers you can drink popping up daily. Do you really need them all?</p>\n<p>How many accounts can you realistically keep track of? Signing up for everything might seem like a good idea but if you don&#8217;t check in regularly you&#8217;ll never know if someone else has.</p>\n<p>Take a few minutes to take stock of your social media sites and don&#8217;t be afraid to delete what you&#8217;re not using. While you can always sigh up again later you can&#8217;t always be sure who might gain access while you&#8217;re away.</p>\n<h3>In short:</h3>\n<p>Being complacent with social media can get you in trouble. Don&#8217;t sign up for every network just because it is new and never access any social network from a computer that isn&#8217;t your own. Finally, make sure you use two-factor authentication for every account you can to keep the bad guys out even if they do crack your password.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://bit51.com/protecting-your-social-media/\">3 Tips For Protecting Your Social Media</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://bit51.com\">Bit51</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://bit51.com/protecting-your-social-media/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:22:\"http://bit51.com/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:11:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 13:28:46 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:23:\"text/xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 22:16:09 GMT\";s:7:\"expires\";s:29:\"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 18:56:10 GMT\";s:6:\"pragma\";s:6:\"public\";s:13:\"cache-control\";s:21:\"max-age=19644, public\";s:12:\"x-powered-by\";s:23:\"W3 Total Cache/0.9.2.11\";s:4:\"vary\";s:0:\"\";s:10:\"x-pingback\";s:27:\"http://bit51.com/xmlrpc.php\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130806170901\";}', 'no') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `option_name` = VALUES(`option_name`), `option_value` = VALUES(`option_value`), `autoload` = VALUES(`autoload`) made by do_action('security_page_better-wp-security-databaseprefix'), call_user_func_array, bwps_admin_content->admin_databaseprefix, Bit51Foo->admin_page, Bit51Foo->news, fetch_feed, SimplePie->init, WP_Feed_Cache_Transient->save, set_transient, add_option
